<p>
The raw yaml of a Pod API Object.  Any pod fields set with non-empty values via the configuration fields above will generally take precedence
as they are merged with this yaml, though in the case of arrays (like Volumes or Tolerations) the objects in the yaml will be appeneded to the
existing list.
</p>

<p>
Fragments of a full Pod API Object yaml representation are allowed, but you must specify enough of the structure to give context
for the object construction.
</p>

<p>
For example, you can start with:

<pre>
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
....
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Or you can just specify the <code>metadata:</code> and <code>spec:</code> sections as needed.
