    <ol>
        <li>Never - always delete the agent pod.</li>
        <li>On Failure - keep the agent pod if it fails during the build.</li>
        <li>On Job Failure - keep the agent pod if the build itself fails.</li>
        <li>Always - always keep the agent pod.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Kubernetes administrators are responsible for managing any kept agent pod.
