    <p>
        This setting controls how agent pods are retained after the Jenkins build completes for this pod template.
        Values other than "Default" will override the plugin's Pod Retention setting.
        The following retention policies are provided:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Always - always keep the agent pod.</li>
        <li>Default - use the Pod Retention setting for the plugin.</li>
        <li>Never - always delete the agent pod.</li>
        <li>On Failure - keep the agent pod if it fails during the build.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Kubernetes administrators are responsible for managing any kept agent pod.
        These will not be deleted by the Jenkins Kubernetes plugin.
    </p>
