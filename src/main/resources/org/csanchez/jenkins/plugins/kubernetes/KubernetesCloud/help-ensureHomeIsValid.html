With this option enabled, the <code>HOME</code> environment variable is set to
the Jenkins working directory. This is useful for Kubernetes environments,
where pods are run with arbritary user IDs (for security reasons) which don't
have an entry in the passwd file of the pod (this seems to be the case in
OpenShift Enterprise).
<p>
For compatibility reasons, this is enabled for systems updated from
kubernetes-plugin 1.16 or older. It is disabled by default.
