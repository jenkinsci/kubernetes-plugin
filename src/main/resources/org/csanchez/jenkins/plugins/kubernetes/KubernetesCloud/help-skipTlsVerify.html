With this option enabled, communication with kubernetes API server will rely on https but will fully ignore ssl
certificate verification. This is usefull for quick setup but does make your installation unsecured, so please consider
twice.
<p>
Alternatively, capture API server certificate and register it as Kubernetes server certificate key.
