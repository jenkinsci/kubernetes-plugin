With this option enabled, if any of the HTTP proxy related environment variables 
recognized by the Jenkins remoting component are set on the Jenkins Controller, they
will be added to the environment variables of any Pod Template.
<p>
Any explicit setting of those variables in the environment variables section of 
the Pod Template or Container Template will take precedence over any variables 
set in Jenkins Controller.
